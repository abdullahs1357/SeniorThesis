-----------------------------------------------------
Overview:
This folder contains all R scripts used for data cleaning, exploration, regression modeling, and visualization 
for the Senior Thesis project. The analysis uses the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2022â€“2023 dataset 
to predict self-reported poor mental health days from behavioral and socioeconomic variables.

-----------------------------------------------------
How to Run the Code:

1. **Requirements**
   - R version 4.3 or later
   - RStudio (recommended)
   - Required R packages:
       tidyverse
       ggplot2
       dplyr
       readr
       car
       caret
       pROC
       reshape2

   Install missing packages using:
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "readr", "car", "caret", "pROC", "reshape2"))

2. **Dataset**
   - The project uses `BRFSS2023_subset_clean.csv` located in the root directory.
   - Ensure the dataset is in your R working directory before running the scripts.

3. **Script Execution Order**
   - Step 1: `BRFSS2023_ANALYSIS.R`
       Cleans and preprocesses the dataset, removing missing values and recoding responses.
   - Step 2: `BRFSS2023_correlation.R`
       Performs correlation analysis, generates heatmaps, scatterplots, and crosstabs.
   - Step 3: `BRFSS2023_regression.R`
       Runs baseline linear and logistic regression models predicting poor mental health days.
   - Step 4: `BRFSS2023_regression_week5.R`
       Refines regression models, calculates odds ratios, confidence intervals, and diagnostic plots.
   - Step 5: `BRFSS2023_regression_weeks6.7.R`
       Incorporates interaction effects (education Ã— income), stratified analyses (by sex and age),
       and computes ROC/AUC metrics with confusion matrices.

4. **Outputs**
   - Model summaries and tables are saved in the `/tables` folder.
   - Plots and figures are saved in the `/plots` folder.
   - Text outputs and logs are in the `/outputs` folder.

5. **Results Summary**
   - Logistic regression model achieved an AUC = 0.731.
   - Key predictors of poor mental health days include low income, low education, smoking, and lack of exercise.
   - Education Ã— income interaction: higher education mitigates the negative effects of low income on mental health.
